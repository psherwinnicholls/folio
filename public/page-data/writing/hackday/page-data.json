The people around you have had the most productive day in weeks. You’ve got shit done, and everyone knows where you’re going next and <em>why</em>. You’ve facilitated a hackday. An ~8 hour event in which a bunch of people collaborate to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>This page is a guide to help you design your own hackday. In the morning you’ll define your problem area, hear from experts and explore the problem space. In the afternoon you’ll hack, build, iterate and share. All before documenting how you smashed through that issue that was blocking you.</p>\n<p>Each hackday is different below is a guide to build your own. I’ll write up specific hack days in future posts. I have split out sections into other posts, so look out for links to checklists and other resources.</p>\n<h2>Before you start</h2>\n<p>You should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-outcome\">decide on an outcome for your hackday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-people\">choose who to invite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-location\">find a venue for your hackday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-shopping-list\">go shopping</a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>On the day</h2>\n<h3>08:00 — Set up</h3>\n<p>Be the first in the room so that you can prep.  I will normally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get coffee, tea, pastries, granola, fruit and water out for everyone</li>\n<li>put on some music — <a href=\"https://poolside.fm\">poolside.fm</a> sets a good vibe</li>\n<li>put a stack of post-its, sharpies and flip-chart paper on each table</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>08:45 — Breakfast meet and greet</h3>\n<p>Welcome everyone individually, remember names and show them around.</p>\n<h3>09:00 — Kick off</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather everyone around the presentation space and welcome them to the hackday.</li>\n<li>Explain what a hackday is and introduce what the outcome of the day will be</li>\n<li>If you have a group of people who don’t know each other, do a round of introductions. Ask the person to your left to say their name, what they do and how they think they can help throughout day. Finally, introduce yourself</li>\n<li>Talk through the agenda, and check if anyone needs to leave early</li>\n<li>Talk through the <a href=\"/writing/hackday-rules\">Hackday rules</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>09:30–11:00 — Know the problem space</h3>\n<p>Choose workshops that will get your attendees on the same page. Assume they are seeing this for the first time and do the hard work for them.</p>\n<p>You could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>run some <a href=\"/writing/lightning-talks/\">lightning talks</a>, or</li>\n<li>create/review assumptions, or</li>\n<li>build a research wall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Split the room into teams of 3–4. This will give you the flexibility to brief each team individually.</p>\n<p>In a recent hackday, I grouped industry experts from the same field into teams alongside product owners, interaction/service designers and developers. These teams played to their strengths and tackled different parts of a complex problem space.</p>\n<h3>11:00–11:15 — Take a short break</h3>\n<p>It might seem early. I’ve literally had people scoff at me. The day is perfectly timed to get the most out of the people in the room. Don’t skip it.</p>\n<h3>11:15–12:45</h3>\n<h3>12:45 — Lunch</h3>\n<p>You’ve put on this workshop so it’s on you to make sure everyone is well fed. Avoid fast-food and takeaways if you want a productive afternoon. Instead swap the comfort food with a lighter option. Think leafy salads, avocado, legumes and cheese.</p>\n<h3>15:00–15:30 — Break</h3>\n<p>This slot is a perfect time for a break. Your participants will be low on energy from lunch. Time for water, caffeine and a sweet treat.</p>\n<h3>16:00 — Share</h3>\n<h3>17:00 — Document</h3>\n<p><strong>Do not skip this step</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you’re a 2 person start-up or a government, having all of your work captured as pictures in a deck will save you time, create a single source of truth and will help you remember what was decided.</p>\n<p>To document your hackday:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ask 1–2 people per team to help you, everyone else should help tidying up</li>\n<li>create a deck and share it with the people helping</li>\n<li>add title slides for each team and each asset you’ve made throughout the day</li>\n<li>take photos of everything</li>\n<li>add the photos to the right section of the deck</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Easy as that.</p>\n<h3>17:30 — Celebrate</h3>\n<p>Be social, relax and hang out. Book a table at a pub, restaurant or go sit in a park.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Get difficult sh*t done with a hackday","date":"04 May, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/writing/hackday/"}}}
