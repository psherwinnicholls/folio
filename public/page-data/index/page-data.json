The people around you have had the most productive day in weeks. You’ve got shit done, and everyone knows what to do next. You’ve facilitated a hackday. An ~8 hour event in which a bunch of people collaborate to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>This page is a guide to help you design your own hackday. In the morning you’ll define your problem area, hear from experts and explore the problem space. In the afternoon you’ll hack, build, iterate and share. All before documenting how you smashed through that issue that was blocking you.</p>\n<p>Each hackday is different below is a guide to build your own. I’ll write up specific hack days in future posts. I have split out sections into other posts, so look out for links to checklists and other resources.</p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Before you start</h2>\n<p>You should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-outcome\">decide on an outcome for your hackday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-people\">choose who to invite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-location\">find a venue for your hackday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-shopping-list\">go shopping</a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>On the day</h2>\n<h3>08:00 — Set up</h3>\n<p>Be the first in the room.  I prepare by:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>getting coffee, tea, pastries, granola, fruit and water out for everyone</li>\n<li>putting on some music — <a href=\"https://poolside.fm\">poolside.fm</a> sets a good vibe</li>\n<li>putting a stack of post-its, sharpies and flipchart paper on each table</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>08:45 — Breakfast meet and greet</h3>\n<p>Welcome everyone individually, remember names and show them around.</p>\n<h3>09:00 — Kick off</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather everyone around the presentation space and welcome them to the hackday.</li>\n<li>Explain what a hackday is and introduce what the outcome of the day will be</li>\n<li>If you have a group of people who don’t know each other, do a round of introductions. Ask the person to your left to say their name, what they do and how they think they can help throughout day. Finally, introduce yourself</li>\n<li>Talk through the agenda, and check if anyone needs to leave early</li>\n<li>Talk through the <a href=\"/writing/hackday-rules\">Hackday rules</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>09:30–11:00 — Know the problem space</h3>\n<p>Choose workshops that will get your attendees on the same page. Assume they are seeing this for the first time. And do the hard work for them so that you don’t burn time.</p>\n<p>Here you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>run a series of <a href=\"/writing/lightning-talks/\">lightning talks</a>, or</li>\n<li>create/review your risky assumptions, or</li>\n<li>build a research wall</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Split the room into teams of 3–4. This will give you the flexibility to brief each team individually. Recently, I grouped industry experts from the same field into teams alongside product owners, interaction/service designers and developers. These teams played to their strengths and tackled different parts of a complex problem space.</p>\n<h3>11:00–11:15 — Take a short break</h3>\n<p>It might seem early. And I’ve literally had people scoff at me. People are normally only useful for about 1½ hours before they should take a break. The day is perfectly timed for that.</p>\n<h3>11:15–12:45 — Break down the problem</h3>\n<p>Wicked complex problems can rarely be solved with a single magical solution. Instead you need to find where you can move the needle and create a solution that works for that part of the problem. Rinse and repeat. Here you want to find <strong>where</strong> the possible solutions could be.</p>\n<p>Here you could:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>affinity sort research data</li>\n<li>create a journey/service map</li>\n<li>research how others have solved similar problems</li>\n<li>run an ideation session, such as ‘bad ideas’</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>12:45–13:30 — Lunch</h3>\n<p>Make sure everyone has an amazing lunch. Avoid fast-food and takeaways if you want a productive afternoon. Instead swap the comfort food with a lighter option. Think leafy salads, avocado, legumes and cheese.</p>\n<p>Encourage attendees pair up for a walk in nature. It’s proven that people are better at convergent thinking when exercising, plus a break in nature will improve their performance in the afternoon. Boom. Double whammy.</p>\n<h3>13:30–15:00 — Make the thing</h3>\n<p>It doesn’t have to be the right thing. Everyone comes out of the hackday having built something. No excuses.</p>\n<p>You could make:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a prototype product or service</li>\n<li>an experiment design</li>\n<li>a series of themes and insights from user research</li>\n<li>a draft report  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>If someone invalidates an idea—that’s something to celebrate. You will have only wasted 1.5 hours to find out it doesn’t work. That’s a win.</p>\n<h3>15:00–15:30 — Afternoon break</h3>\n<p>This slot is a perfect time for a break. Your participants will be in a mid-afternoon slump. Time for water, caffeine and a sweet treat.</p>\n<h3>15:30–16:00 — Final touches</h3>\n<p>Finish up and prepare to show the thing.</p>\n<h3>16:00–16:50 — Show the thing</h3>\n<p>Each team presents what they’ve built and answers questions. Choose the presentation type based on the personalities in the room and the type of product.</p>\n<p>Attendees could give a:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>30 second elevator pitch.</li>\n<li>demo of product or service</li>\n<li>presentation or lightning talk</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>16:50–17:00 — Wrap up</h3>\n<p>Find out how the day was and what they got out of it. Was anything surprising?\nMake sure you share how it was for you, before thanking everyone.</p>\n<h3>17:00 — Document</h3>\n<p><strong>Do not skip this step</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you’re growing a start-up or a working with a government, documenting the day is key. Take pictures, add them to a deck will save you time, create a single source of truth and will help you remember what was decided.</p>\n<p>To document your hackday:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ask 1–2 people per team to help you, everyone else should help tidying up</li>\n<li>create a deck and share it with the people helping</li>\n<li>add title slides for each team and each asset you’ve made throughout the day</li>\n<li>take photos of everything. Make sure post-its are in focus and not covering other post-its</li>\n<li>add the photos to the right section of the deck</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Easy as that.</p>\n<h3>17:30 — Celebrate</h3>\n<p>Be social, relax and hang out. Book a table at a pub or restaurant or go sit in a park.  </p>","frontmatter":{"type":"writing","title":"Get difficult sh*t done with a hackday","link":null,"description":null}}},{"node":{"id":"51dbe7ed-c96e-5733-88df-f19eb7bd474b","html":"<p>For healthy workshops:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>No question is a stupid question</li>\n<li>If you’re not adding to the conversation, join another</li>\n<li>You don’t need permission to go to the toilet</li>\n<li>Instant feedback is better than late feedback</li>\n<li>Be critical, followed up by being constructive</li>\n<li>It’s okay to say “I don’t know”, and then go find out</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"type":"writing","title":"Hackday: Rules","link":null,"description":null}}},{"node":{"id":"b9f9deb8-2888-5032-a0ea-c5b269ce683d","html":"<p>This post is a part of a series that will go deep on <a href=\"/writing/hackday\">How to design, run and get buy-in for hackdays</a>.</p>\n<p>The best teams are the ones with a diverse group of people and cultures.
