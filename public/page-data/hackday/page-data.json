The people around you have had the most productive day in weeks. You’ve got shit done, and everyone knows where you’re going next and <em>why</em>. You’ve facilitated a hackday. An ~8 hour event in which a bunch of people collaborate to solve a problem.</p>\n<p>This page is a guide to help you design your own hackday. In the morning you’ll define your problem area, hear from experts and explore the problem space. In the afternoon you’ll hack, build, iterate and share. All before documenting how you smashed through that issue that was blocking you.</p>\n<p>Each hackday is different, but this structure will see you through. To make it digestible I have split out sections into other posts, so look out for links for checklists and other resources.</p>\n<h2>Before you start</h2>\n<p>You should:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-outcome\">decide on an outcome for your hackday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-people\">choose who to invite</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-location\">find a venue for your hackday</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/writing/hackday-shopping-list\">go shopping</a></li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h2>On the day</h2>\n<h3>08:00 — Set up</h3>\n<p>Be the first in the room so that you can prep.  I will normally:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>get coffee, tea, pastries, granola, fruit and water out for everyone</li>\n<li>put on some music — <a href=\"https://poolside.fm\">poolside.fm</a> sets a good vibe</li>\n<li>put a stack of post-its, sharpies and flip-chart paper on each table</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>08:45 — Breakfast meet and greet</h3>\n<p>Welcome everyone individually, remember names and show them around.</p>\n<h3>09:00 — Kick off</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Gather everyone around the presentation space and welcome them to the hackday.</li>\n<li>Explain what a hackday is and introduce what the outcome of the day will be</li>\n<li>If you have a group of people who don’t know each other, do a round of introductions. Ask the person to your left to say their name, what they do and how they think they can help throughout day. Finally, introduce yourself</li>\n<li>Talk through the agenda, and check if anyone needs to leave early</li>\n<li>Talk through the <a href=\"/writing/hackday-rules\">Hackday rules</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h3>09:30 — Lightning talks</h3>\n<p>Aim for three 10 minute talks from people who have experience with the problem.\nGive 5–10 minutes for questions at the end of each talk. The purpose of this is to get everyone on the same page and thinking about the problem.</p>\n<p>The lightning talks could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>how others have solved the problem</li>\n<li>what are the details of the problem</li>\n<li>a meta-analysis of existing research</li>\n<li>user research highlight reels</li>\n<li>a demo of a product or service</li>\n<li>a talk or YouTube video</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Keep the speakers on time with a stopwatch. Make sure to check slides are <em>actually</em> needed, asking speakers to keep them short and simple.</p>\n<h3>10:15 — Getting hands on</h3>\n<p>Mapping and defining the problem</p>\n<h3>12:00 — Lunch</h3>\n<p>You’ve put on this workshop so it’s on you to make sure everyone is well fed. Avoid fast-food and takeaways if you want a productive afternoon. Instead swap the comfort food with a lighter option. Think leafy salads, avocado, legumes and cheese.</p>\n<h3>15:00–15:30 — Break</h3>\n<p>This slot is a perfect time for a break. Your participants will be low on energy from lunch. Time for water, caffeine and a sweet treat.</p>\n<h3>16:00 — Share</h3>\n<h3>17:00 — Document</h3>\n<p><strong>Do not skip this step</strong>. It doesn’t matter if you’re a 2 person start-up or a government, having all of your work captured as pictures in a deck will save you time, create a single source of truth and will help you remember what was decided.</p>\n<p>To document your hackday:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>ask 1–2 people per team to help you, everyone else should help tidying up</li>\n<li>create a deck and share it with the people helping</li>\n<li>add title slides for each team and each asset you’ve made throughout the day</li>\n<li>take photos of everything</li>\n<li>add the photos to the right section of the deck</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Easy as that.</p>\n<h3>17:30 — Celebrate</h3>\n<p>Be social, relax and hang out. Book a table at a pub, restaurant or go sit in a park.  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Get difficult sh*t done with a hackday","date":"04 May, 2020"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/hackday/"}}}
