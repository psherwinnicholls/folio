The first rule is: **do it as a team.**

Not just your immediate user-centred design colleagues either. You need 4–8 people per experiment—so dust off your stakeholders, and get invites out to Ops, Policy and Sales. Tell them that they are needed for the whole day, no exceptions. No phones. No laptops. No meetings. Just good ol' me-and-user time.


## Get data
Quant and qual
Primary and secondary
Do some user research
Take notes
Use a transcription tool
Post-it note quotes
***Document — Keep all of them***
After each session, reflects, iterate and **capture Gold quotes as they come up**


Get ready for the big day
```
You should have:
- piles of session notes
- hours of recordings
- assumptions or hypothesis that you were testing
- lots of wall space
- blue-tac
- sharpies
- highlighters
- discussion guide
```

Congratulations. You've got some egos in room. It's time to level the playing field. Today is not about individual performance, it's about playing the detective.

Acknowledge your biases as a team. Speak about:
- how you have incentivised the participants
- how you recruited them
- what you asked them
- what you showed them
- individual bias around the table

It's near on impossible to avoid all bias, and by being transparent, others can challenge you and help you iterate your methodology. If you have found that a bias is influencing a finding, you should either caveat the finding or omit it.

Beware of strong stories. , and these stories stick with us

User research can unearth deep emotional and psychological issues for both participants and researcher. If you don't have a mental health process in place I suggest reading [Psychological safety for researchers](https://hodigital.blog.gov.uk/2019/02/15/psychological-safety-for-researchers/) at the from Tristan Ostrowski at the Home Office.

## Scrub the data
Remove duplicates this is where 2 note takers captured the same quote at the same time.
***Document — keep all of them***

Add the post-it notes to the 'Found' section of the research wall

## Find patterns
gather up all of your quotes
Could be on post-it notes, could be a transcript and affinity sort this unstructured data to find themes.
If you have them, group the quotes against your hypotheses or assumptions.
Write out your insights.
	None/Some/**Many**/Most/All users  
	were confident using the internet
	Here you can include a hunch or an explanation
***Document the quotes, themes and insights - keep them all***

You should this after each round of research. If possible after each session. As it is difficult to remember what that user said 3 weeks ago. You may have a recording but nothing beats coming together as a team and drawing out fresh findings.

Knowledge book
Not everyone gets to use shiny tools like Miro, Muraly or Figma to do group work remotely. So I’ve found a solid contender in Google Slides.

Build the structure
Write each theme or assumption its own title page
Create a new page with the quotes from the theme
Create another new page with the insights

Now this is where it gets dirty.

You’ll need to

If you’ve been smart, you’ve been doing this as you go. Not at the end. Not like me.

We’re aiming for an evidence base. Which will likely be some kind of gross spreadsheet, perhaps an Airtable if you’re lucky.


Chapters are assumptions
Quotes
Insights
Findings mapped to assumptions

How can you modularise this content?
Don’t just write a blog most
Capture each methodology in a article/video
