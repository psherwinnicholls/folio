A 10 minute talk. No slides. Questions at the end.

As part of a [hackday](/writing/hackday) you might run multiple lightning talks in sequence. Give 5â€“10 minutes for questions at the end of each talk. In a hackday, the purpose of a lightning talk is to get everyone on the same page and thinking about the problem.

Lightning talks could include:

- how others have solved the problem
- what are the details of the problem
- a meta-analysis of existing research
- user research highlight reels
- a demo of a product or service
- a talk or YouTube video

Keep the speakers on time with a stopwatch. Make sure to check slides are truly needed, asking speakers to keep them short and simple.
