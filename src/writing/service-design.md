our education system teaches us to think in silos:

- years
- classes
- groups
- history
- english
- maths
- art
- physics
- IT 

As we progress through life, we're encouraged to narrow down and get good at one thing.



we then take that through into our careers

- departments
- job roles
- tribes
- squads
- guilds

and even though we know the benefits of hashing out problems as a team, many don't do it.

the best artists and scientists broke those silos
