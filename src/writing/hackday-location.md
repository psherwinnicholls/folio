This post is a part of a series that will go deep on [How to design, run and get buy-in for hackdays](/writing/hackdays).

You'll need a space to call home for the day. Hire a venue if you need to. You will be running workshops, presentations and games so it needs to be flexible. The value of getting these people in a room for a day without distractions is worth it.

You should find a space that:

- has desks which you can move, preferably in a cabaret layout
- has lots of wall space
- has a TV or projector
- has fast WiFi
- has no distractions
- meets your attendees accessibility needs
- has water, coffee, tea, snacks on demand
- provides lunch
