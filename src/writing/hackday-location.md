This post is a part of a series that will go deep on [How to design, run and get buy-in for hackdays](/writing/hackday).

You'll need a space to call home for the day. Hire a venue if you need to. You will be running workshops, presentations and games so it needs to be flexible. The value of getting these people in a room for a day without distractions is worth it.

You should find a space that:

- [ ] has tables that you can move around, preferably in a cabaret layout
- [ ] has lots of wall space
- [ ] has a TV or projector
- [ ] has fast WiFi
- [ ] has no distractions
- [ ] meets accessibility needs
- [ ] has water, coffee, tea, snacks on demand
- [ ] provides lunch
