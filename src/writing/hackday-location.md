You'll need a flexible space to call home for the day so you can move between workshops, presentations and games.

The value of getting a room for a day without distractions is totally worth itâ€”hire a venue if you need to.

You should find a space that:

- [ ] has tables that you can move around, preferably in a cabaret layout
- [ ] has lots of wall space
- [ ] has a TV or projector
- [ ] has fast WiFi
- [ ] has no distractions
- [ ] meets accessibility needs
- [ ] has water, coffee, tea, snacks on demand
- [ ] provides lunch
