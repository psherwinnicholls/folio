The best teams are the ones with a diverse group of people and cultures. That's where you get the most value. Challenging intelligent people to solve cross disciplinary problems forces them to come up with new ways of thinking.

Make a list of all of your stakeholders. It might look something like this:

- your immediate team
- line managers
- users
- experts
- your users
- people who interact with your users e.g. customer support
- senior management
- founders
- C-suite

Sort them into people you must, should, could and won't invite. This will give you a bunch of back-ups if people can't make the date.
