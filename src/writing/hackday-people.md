This post is a part of a series that will go deep on [How to design, run and get buy-in for hackdays](/writing/hackday).

The best hackdays are the ones with a diverse group of people in a room, that's where you get the most value. By challenging intelligent people to solve a problem across disciplines forces them to come up with new ways of thinking. See my post on [choosing the right people for your hackday](/writing/hackday-people).

## Must get these people
The people closest to you on your stakeholder blueprint.

- your immediate team
- users
- stakeholders
- experts — you can’t always get a full day of their time as they may not be a part of your organisation. Ask them to prepare a 10 minute recording of an area of their knowledge.
