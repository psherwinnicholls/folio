For a healthy workshop:

### 1. No question is a stupid question

### 2. If you're not adding to the conversation, join another

### 3. You don't need permission to go to the toilet

### 4. Instant feedback is better than late feedback

### 5. Be critical, followed up by being constructive

### 6. It's okay to say "I don't know", and then find out
