<!-- This post is a part of a series that will go deep on [How to design, run and get buy-in for hackdays](). -->

Cut to the end of the day. The people around you have had the most productive day in weeks. You've got shit done, and everyone knows where you're going next and _why_. You've run a hackday. An 8 hour event in which multidisciplinary teams collaborate to solve a problem. These posts are a guide to help you design your own.


Each hackday will be different,
A successful hackday is efficient and fun.


## Before you start
Decide on an outcome



The people closest to you on your stakeholder blueprint.

- your immediate team
- users
- stakeholders
- experts — you can’t always get a full day of their time as they may not be a part of your organisation. Ask them to prepare a 10 minute recording of an area of their knowledge.

## How

## Where
You'll need a space to call home for the day. Hire a venue if you need to. You will be running workshops, presentations and games so it needs to be flexible. The value of getting these people in a room for a day without distractions is worth it.

You should find a space that:

- has desks which you can move, preferably in a cabaret layout
- has lots of wall space
- has a TV or projector
- has fast WiFi
- has no distractions
- meets your attendees accessibility needs
- has water, coffee, tea, snacks on demand


## When

Mondays are best.
