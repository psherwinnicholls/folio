This post is a part of a series that will go deep on [How to design, run and get buy-in for hackdays](/writing/hackdays).

You need to figure out what you want your outcome to be. This will help you choose the right people to invite and what activities to run. It could be to prototype a service, create a research plan or mock-up a book. It doesn't matter what you're trying to achieve as long as it forces you to build the thing by the end of the day.
